    <h1>Elephant</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Elephantidae</strong> is a family of large, herbivorous
      proboscidean mammals collectively called elephants and mammoths. These are
      large terrestrial mammals with a snout modified into a trunk and teeth
      modified into tusks. Most genera and species in the family are extinct.
      Only two genera,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant"><em>Loxodonta</em></a>
      (African elephants) and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephas" target="_blank"><em>Elephas</em></a> (Asian
      elephants), are living. The family was first described by John Edward Gray
      in 1821,[4] and later assigned to taxonomic ranks within the order
      Proboscidea. Elephantidae has been revised by various authors to include
      or exclude other extinct proboscidean genera.
