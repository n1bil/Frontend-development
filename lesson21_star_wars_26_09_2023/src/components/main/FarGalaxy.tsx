            Long ago in a galaxy far far away... the Old Republic fell. On its
            ruins, the Sith Order created a galactic Empire, subjugating one
            planetary system after another. Alliance forces seek to overthrow
            the Dark Emperor and restore free rule to the galaxy. General
            Obi-Wan Kenobi returns after years of seclusion to once again face
            the Lord of Darkness Darth Vader. Together with him on the light
            side of the Force are the young pilot Luke, the son of Anakin
            Skywalker, Princess Senator Leia Organa, the legendary Correlian
            smuggler Han Solo and his friend Chewbacca.
